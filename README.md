# ðŸ”Ž Laboratory

Below are a series of activities to be solved based on what you have learned in this first week of learning:

1) Answer the following question: What is Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and why is cybersecurity necessary?

2) In the table below, some components of a computer are shown. Complete the table with the definition of each component and its function.

### 

| Hardware | Definition | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RAM (Random Access Memory) |  |  |
| Hard Drive |  |  |
| Processor |  |  |
| Network Card |  |  |
| Motherboard |  |  |

3) Conduct research and develop a hypothesis on the following premise:

Linux is a kernel, and based on it, different operating systems have been developed, such as Ubuntu, ElementaryOS, Kali, Parrot OS, and Fedora. Operating systems built on the Linux kernel are preferred by technical/advanced users, including cybersecurity professionals, as it allows for more personalized control over computing devices.

> ðŸ’¡ Hint: Why do cybersecurity professionals and system administrators prioritize using Linux? Argue your response. Developing your thought process is crucial to becoming a great ethical hacker.

4) In a software development company called "TechSolutions," security issues related to access control to its internal systems have arisen. Some employees have reported noticing unusual activities in their accounts and data, suggesting possible unauthorized access. The company's management is concerned about information security and has asked you to evaluate the situation. Some employees have reported noticing unusual activities in their accounts and data, suggesting possible unauthorized access. The company's management is concerned about information security and has asked you to evaluate the situation. What would you do?

>ðŸ’¡ Hint: 2FA/MFA, permission management, access control

5) Complete the following table by defining the mentioned cyberattacks and indicating which cybersecurity principles are affected:

| Cyberattack | Definition | Affected Principle(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ransomware |  |  |
| Trojan Horse (Trojan) |  |  |
| Virus |  |  |
| DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) |  |  |

6) Imagine you are an employee of a small company named "EcoTech," dedicated to selling eco-friendly products. The management has decided to establish a LAN (Local Area Network) to improve communication and file exchange among employees in the office. With the knowledge you have acquired so far, what steps or considerations would you take into account to set up a small LAN in the EcoTech office? Describe at least three actions that you think would be important.

7) Based on the cybersecurity regulations studied this week, develop your personal opinion on why you should stay updated on the subject and its importance in your professional career.

8) Imagine you work for a small company handling confidential customer information, such as credit card details and personal data. Why do you think it would be important for your company to use cryptography techniques to protect this information? Describe at least two reasons why cryptography could be valuable in this situation.
